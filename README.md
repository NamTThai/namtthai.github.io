## Getting started
The project needs to be behind a web server. Here is how to host a simple webserver:

1. You will need `node.js` and `git`
2. Use `npm` to install the following modules if you don't have it currently: bower, polyserve

e.g. `npm install -g bower`

3. Navigate to project directory and install dependencies: `npm install` `bower install`
4. Start polyserve to host the project behind localhost: `polyserve -p PORT_NUMBER`. At this point, polyserve will tell you how to find the project in your web browser.
